A "particle" simulator written in Python 3 using pyglet

Sean if your reading this:
  - open a command prompt and type 'pip install pyglet'
  - if it fails it might give you a link for something to install from microsoft, grab that then run the above again
  - use the following commands to run it

To run the application, 'python main.py'
To run the tests, 'python main.py test'

Currently building up to the simulation by building the required classes and functions
